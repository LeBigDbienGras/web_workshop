# web_workshop
web_workshop project by Darius Nallet


In this project, I coded a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which interacts with and receives data from the electronic assembly that I also built. The aim of this project was to experiment with the basics in these fields, allowing me to reuse the skills Iâ€™ve learned in the future if needed. The website communicates with the ESP32 on the PCB through a WebSocket, and I programmed the ESP32 using Arduino code. The website features a homepage that leads to a control page, where users can adjust the brightness of an LED in real-time, control a motor, and monitor data from a photoresistor, which sends ambient light information every second. The entire setup is powered by batteries, making the assembly self-sufficient.
